- High concentrations of BCAAs can cause oxidative stress and inflammation. 
- BCAA supplementation can lead to changes in body's natural chemistry, such as increased glutamine content and altered neurotransmission. 
- Potential side effects of BCAA include draining of alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia formation in the gut and kidneys.
- In some cases, BCAAs can be used by cancer cells as a source of energy, promoting their growth. 
- However, BCAA supplementation can also decrease malnourishment and weight loss during chemotherapy.
- BCAAs can improve event-free survival in cirrhotic patients, but they may cause gastrointestinal symptoms.
- Other side effects of BCAA solutions may include acidosis, hyperammonemia, hypercalciuria, and bone disease or liver damage.

- BCAA administration has been noted to improve plasma aminoacid balance, albumin, Ch-E, total cholesterol, and the level of consciousness disturbance in chronic severe liver diseases.
- BCAA-enriched solutions can improve metabolism and maintain good nitrogen retention without increasing side effects compared to conventional solutions.
- High-dose BCAA usage in critically ill patients has been observed without complications or side-effects.
