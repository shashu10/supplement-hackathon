- A daily supplement of 12g BCAA taken orally for 2 years can improve the quality of life and survival rate in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. (2005)
- The study tested different BCAA doses: 0.16, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 g/kg/day, and found that a dosage of 0.5g/kg/day begins to retain nitrogen effect. (1983)
- An optimal BCAA dosage for muscle recovery and function after high-intensity resistance exercise is 2-10g per day. (2021)
- A daily dosage of 210 and 450mg per kg of body weight has been seen to reduce some signs of muscle damage following heavy resistance exercise in wrestlers. (2011)
- However, the same dosage (210 and 450mg per kg of body weight) did not decrease muscle damage related to heavy resistance exercise in a different study on wrestlers. (2011)
- BCAA supplements of 12g L-leucine, 8g L-isoleucine, and 6.4g L-valine were taken in a study, but the outcomes were not provided. (1996)
- A dosage of 0.087g/kg of BCAA after hypertrophy-based training improved strength recovery, jump height, and reduced muscle soreness among controlled diet athletes. (2017)
- 200 and 450mg/kg BCAA dosage did not have an impact on muscle soreness or damage during resistance exercises in soccer players. (2013)
- Consuming 70mg/kg of body weight of BCAA daily in rats during cyclic starvation caused a decrease in IL-10 and an increase in IL-1a and IL-2. (2019)
- In a study, BCAA was supplemented at 0.08g/kg/day which totals to 3.52g BCAA/day and 10.32g AA/day. (2020)
